Machine Learning Engineer | Robotics Researcher | Software Developer

## About Me
I'm a Machine Learning graduate student at the University of Tübingen with extensive experience in robotics, computer vision, and reinforcement learning. Currently pursuing my Master's in Machine Learning while participating in an Erasmus exchange at Politecnico di Milano, I combine theoretical knowledge with practical applications across multiple domains.
My work spans from developing deep learning pipelines for medical applications to implementing vision-guided imitation learning for robotics. I'm passionate about creating intelligent systems that can learn and adapt to complex environments.
